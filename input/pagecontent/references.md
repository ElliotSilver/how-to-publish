Useful sources of information on publication with the FHIR IG Publisher include:

### IG Publication

#### IG Publisher Publication Resources

Note that these are not controlled publications, so they may change. They also may occasionally conflate things that need to be done for the IG Publisher tool to work correctly with the HL7 organizational processes and requirements.

##### HL7 International Confluence pages

* [Getting Started with IG Publisher](https://hl7.github.io/docs/ig_publisher/getting-started)
